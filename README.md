Please follow the instructions for setting up and running the application on ubuntu environment:

* Please install Ruby 2.3+

* Please install Rails 5+

* Run : bundle install 

* Run : rake db:create

* Run : rake db:migrate

* Start up the application with : rails server




I haven't tried to make the app look aesthetically pleasing, just some basic styling with bootstrap is added.
